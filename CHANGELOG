### V2.2.0

### V2.1.1
New features : 
 - Sync your manga list over different instances of your favorite browser (option in general, and sync in your browser)
 - First working (usable) version on Firefox for Android
 - Option to check for new version of the extension, be notified right in the popup (option is enabled by default on Chromium based browsers)
 - Open manga chapter page when clicking manga name (in reader and popup)
 - Option to wait for n seconds between two manga update requests (check for new chapters) ACTIVATE this option is you keep being banned from MANGADEX (it requires quite a few mangas on your list)
Fixes

### V2.1.0

### V2.0.3
Websites implementation improvements (A lot of implementations have been added thanks to these improvements) : 
 - Abstract implementation for mirrors (A lot of websites are based on CMS like FoolSlide). Implement once for multiple websites
 - Add a global helper accessible from implementation to reduce implementation code and improve readability
 - Update the interface of websites implementation to be more modern (Promises and ES6 code)
 
Languages support, handle multi lingual mangas :
 - in search results, language is taken into account to display results (an implementation can return mangas in different languages on search request)
 - in manga list, some implementations manage manga chapters in different languages, in this case, a flag next to the manga is displayed and allow the user to add other languages for the same manga
 - option with readable languages list and auto deactivation of unreadable implementations
 - language categories : if mangas are read in more than one language, native categories are added to filter by language

Misc
 - Improve the way chapters lists are displayed
 - Improve Import functionnality to avoid errors (unknown websites, last chapter read url has been changed, try to guess the best one)
 - Improve bookmarks display by using built in implementation function (allow issues for displaying scans from some websites)
 - Add link in popup to open popup in new tab
 - Upgrade webpack to version 4
 - add a build mode build:dev-watch to hot reload extension in chrome while developing
 - Remove babel and regenerator runtime as browser now supports native ES6
 
Fixes : 
 - load implementation scripts multiple times and do not free them from memory
 - Force table to be displayed correctly from content script (on some mirrors, scans were forced to the left)
 - Delete unused language categories if needed
 - Add last chapter published label at the end of the chapter if it is the last one while reading (this label disappeared between V1 and V2)
 - popup does not disappear when removing a manga from a group
 - empty manga added from search panel if multiple languages proposed
 - css when displaying a "last time updated badge" on a manga
 - Firefox scrollbar in popup (keep it in detached popup, ie new tab popup)
 - border top radius of manga list if first item is a grouped manga
